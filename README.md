# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator* 

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculation application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Khuziama Rehman**

Time spent: **11** hours spent in total
This project took around 2 hours to get working, however as I started to implement designs and additional features i came across bugs that set me back such as the app not loading up or errors in the low level language that looks similar to assembly code represented by "Threading" as well as simple bugs such as the keyboard not popping up. Unfortunatelty I did not have a backup working project on my github, therefore had to restart. I will definetely be saving my work by pushing working versions onto github next time! 

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [ ] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] I can improve this application by making the UI more aesthetic.
- [ ] Making the app have different feautures such as a new keyboard layout instead of the decimal keyboard will make it more visually appealing.

## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

A few Challenges I had while making this application was getting certain styles to work. Getting the application to function was fairly simple, however, once I added some styling and tried to make the app more aesthetic, i was getting unknown errors and it was difficult for me to debugg the code as it is my first time using both xcode and swift. The error i was getting was "Cant find keyplane that supports type 8 for keyboard". In addition I kept getting threading errors as well as errors while running my code as the application was not opening up on certain phone simulators on xcode. I managed to find time to redo the project as before i had not pushed a valid working project version onto my github, but next time i will for sure push working versions onto github before testing out new implementations and designs!
